Project for under bed lighting.
PIR sensors on either side of the bed, should make it easier to see at night with dimmed light.
Either side of the bed has PIR sensor, LED strip (length can be choosen by you), and a ring LED lights for the lights on the nightstand.

Software to control this all is either WLED or ESPHOME in Home Assistant. In both cases, code will follow.
