# BedLight
Project for under bed lighting with PIR motion sensors.
PIR sensors on either side of the bed, should make it easier to see at night with dimmed light when you get out of bed.
Either side of the bed has PIR sensor, LED strip (length can be choosen by you), and a ring LED light for the lights on the nightstand.

Software to control this all is either WLED or ESPHOME in Home Assistant. In both cases, code will follow.
